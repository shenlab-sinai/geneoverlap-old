\title{
    Matrix representation of the pairwise overlaps between two gene sets
}
\description{
    Given one or two gene sets each contains one or more gene lists, create a 
    matrix to represent all pairwise comparisons between the gene lists. This 
    class also provides functions to visualize the matrix.
}
\usage{
\S4method{show}{GeneOverlapMatrix}(object)
\S4method{print}{GeneOverlapMatrix}(object)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{A GeneOverlapMatrix object.}
}
\details{
    The problem is stated as the representation of all pairwise comparisons 
    between two gene sets each contains one or more gene lists. This is 
    represented as a matrix where the rows correspond to one gene set and the 
    columns correspond to the other. Each grid represents the overlap between 
    two gene lists of the corresponding row and column. This class calls the
    GeneOverlap constructor to create objects that represent the overlapping
    information. When there is only one gene set, the matrix represents the 
    self-comparison within the gene set and only the upper triangular matrix is 
    used.

    The significance of gene overlap is characterized by two pieces of 
    information: odds ratio and p-value. This class provides functions to 
    visualize these information as a heatmap. The darkness of the color of each 
    grid represents the odds ratio while the texts superimposed on the grids 
    state the p-values.
