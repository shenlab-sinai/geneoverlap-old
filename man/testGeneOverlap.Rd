\title{
    Test function for the GeneOverlap class
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
    Perform Fisher's exact test based on the information supplied in the 
    GeneOverlap object, such as gene list A, B and genome size. Set the tested
    Boolean label.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
\S4method{testGeneOverlap}{GeneOverlap}(object)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{A GeneOverlap object.}
}
\value{
    A GeneOverlap object with valid p-value, odds ratio and contingency table. 
    The tested Boolean label is set to true. Use show or print to display a 
    summary of the object. Use accessors to get information of each slot.
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
%% ...
