\title{
    Read-only accessors for the "intersection", "union", "is.tested", 
    "cont.tbl", "pval", "odds.ratio" slots of the GeneOverlap class
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
    The intersection and union slots contain the gene names as character 
    vectors. The is.tested slot contains a Boolean label indicating whether the 
    object has been tested or not. The cont.tbl slot contains the contingency 
    table as a matrix. The pval and odds.ratio slots contain the p-value and 
    odds ratio as numerics, respectively. 
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
  A GeneOverlap object.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
}
\details{
    If the GeneOverlap object has not been tested yet, the returned p-value and 
    odds ratio will be NA, the contingency table will be an empty matrix.
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
  \item{intersection}{A character vector represents the overlapped genes.}
  \item{union}{A character vector represents the genes in the union of A and 
  B.}
  \item{is.tested}{A Boolean represents whether the overlapping test has been 
  performed or not.}
  \item{cont.tbl}{A matrix represents the contingency table.}
  \item{pval}{A numeric represents the significance of overlap.}
  \item{odds.ratio}{A numeric represents the odds ratio in comparison to the
  genomic background.}
