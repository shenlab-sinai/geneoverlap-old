\title{
    Accessors for the "listA" and "listB" slots of GeneOverlap class
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
    The listA and listB slots hold the gene lists A and B as character vectors.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
\S4method{getListA}{GeneOverlap}(object)
\S4method{setListA}{GeneOverlap}(object) <- value
\S4method{getListB}{GeneOverlap}(object)
\S4method{setListB}{GeneOverlap}(object) <- value
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{A GeneOverlap object.}
  \item{value}{A character vector representing gene names.}
}
\details{
    After setListX function is called, the tested Boolean label will be reset 
    to false.
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
    A character vector representing gene list A/B.
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
